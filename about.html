    <h1><b>ABOUT GIT</b></h1>
    <hr>
    <p><b>Git is a distributed version control system used for tracking changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 to manage the development of the Linux kernel, but it's now widely used for projects of all sizes and types.

        Here are some key concepts and features of Git:</b></p>
        <hr>
        
        <p><b>1. Version Control: </b> Tracks changes to files over time, allowing multiple developers to collaborate on a project simultaneously.</p>
        
        <p><b>2. Distributed:</b> Unlike centralized version control systems, such as SVN, Git is distributed. Each developer has a complete copy of the repository, including its history.</p>
        
        <p><b>3. Branching and Merging:</b> Git makes branching and merging operations easy and efficient. Developers can create branches to work on new features or fixes independently, then merge those changes back into the main branch.</p>
        
        <p><b>4. Commit:</b> A commit is a snapshot of changes made to the repository at a specific point in time. Each commit has a unique identifier (hash) and includes metadata such as the author, timestamp, and commit message.</p>
        
       <p><b> 5. Remote Repositories:</b> Git supports remote repositories, such as those hosted on services like GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket. Developers can push their changes to these remote repositories to share their work with others.</p>
        
       <p><b> 6. Pull Requests:</b> Many Git hosting services offer pull requests, which allow developers to propose changes to a project and request that others review and merge them. This workflow is common in open-source projects and encourages collaboration and code quality.</p>
        
       <p><b> 7. Merge Conflicts:</b> When Git is unable to automatically merge changes, it reports a merge conflict. Developers must resolve these conflicts manually by editing the affected files and choosing which changes to keep.</p>
        
        <p><b>8. Git Workflow:</b> There are several Git workflows, including centralized, feature branch, Gitflow, and others. These define conventions and best practices for how developers collaborate and manage changes in a repository.</p>
        <hr>
       <p><b> Overall, Git is a powerful tool for version control and collaboration, enabling developers to work together efficiently and manage complex software projects effectively.</b></p>
